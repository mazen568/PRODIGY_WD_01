1-not all of your code must be in components (does not have props or states) you can put it in the index.html file
2-all files in the public directory will always be available tp your website visitors
3-component instances work in isolation (for example if i click on one component instance button to display something the other component will not be affeted only the component itself i clicked on will be affeted the other component)
3-best practice of updating the state based on old state is passing a function like in the Player.jsx file 
4-it is strongly recommended that if your state is an object or array you update that state in an immutable way 
6-lifting the state up to the closeset ancestor componment that hass acceess to all the components that need to work with that state
7-in our case we want to know which player is active
